## **Rethinking the Temporal Modeling for Time Series Forecasting with Hybrid Modeling**

This code repository provides the necessary code and scripts to reproduce the experiments from the paper titled 'RETHINKING THE TEMPORAL MODELING FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING WITH HYBRID MODELING.' You can replicate the experimental results from the paper by configuring and running the scripts under the `./UniTS_script/` directory, as well as using the `./UniTS_Exp.py` and `./model/UniTS.py` scripts.

Additionally, we also offer an unofficial version of TiDE (Temporal Information Density Estimation) available at [TiDE Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pCbC3aQB5W). You can attempt to replicate the performance of this model in various settings by configuring and executing the scripts under the `./TiDE_Exp.py` directory and utilizing the `./model/TiDE.py` script.
